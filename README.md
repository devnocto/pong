# Pong

A simple implementation of the pong game. Separated into the frontend and backend. The frontend is developed using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) while the backend is developed using [Go](https://go.dev/) and [gorilla/websockets](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket).

Two players can play over the internet. All inputs coming from any webpage directs to player 1 or player 2. The frontend and backend folders contain their respective `README.md` files with more details.
